# Introduction
The goal of our project is to develop a command shell that
1. prints a command prompt **$**
2. reads in any line of command
3. executes the command using **fork**, **execvp**, and **waitpid**. 

The commands can be seperated by ```&&```, ```||```, and ```;``` where the command executes only if
```
&& - the first one was successful
|| - the first one failed
; - is always executed 
```
